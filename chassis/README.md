C.A.E.S.A.R. Bot Chassis
========================

Introduction
----------------
The C.A.E.S.A.R. Bot Chassis is designed to take advantage of the Mini Sumo Robot Rules' allowance of a robot of any height, as long as it still fits in a 10x10cm (L x W) starting square. C.A.E.S.A.R Bot will start with the ramp angled upward, and will "fall" as soon as the round starts. This design gives C.A.E.S.A.R Bot a nice long ramp that can get underneath the opponent's robot’s wheels for easier pushing.

Construction
-----------------
The current iteration (v0.1) of the C.A.E.S.A.R Bot chassis is intended to be cut out of 5.2mm material. Our prototype has been lasercut out of 5.2mm plywood and fits together nicely. Future revisions will be required as sensors are added, and other materials and thicknesses may be utilized as well.

Notes
--------
The red square included in each design file represents a 1x1in square so that importing the files into other editors can be done while maintaining accurate dimensions. If, when imported into your editor of choice, the red square is not approximately 1x1in, please resize all of the parts and the square so that the square is 1x1in.
